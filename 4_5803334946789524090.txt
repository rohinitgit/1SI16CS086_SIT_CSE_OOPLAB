Type Conversions with User Defined Types

Basic to User-Defined
============================================
To go from a basic type to a user-defined type we use a constructor with one argument. 
These are sometimes called conversion constructors.

You can also use the overloaded assignment operator


From User-Defined to Basic
============================================
We use a conversion operator.

A conversion function must be a member function, may not specify a return type, 
and must have an empty parameter list. The function usually should be const.

Conversions between two user-defined types. 
============================================
you can use a one-argument constructor 

				or 
				
you can use a conversion operator.

Class A to Class B in Class A
	it is implemented as a conversion operator.
	
Class B to Class A in Class A
	it is implemented using a one-argument constructor 
	
Class B to Class A in Class B
	it is implemented as a conversion operator.

Class A to Class B in Class B
	it is implemented using a one-argument constructor
